              No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It
              belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of businesses who
              offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi
              Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors
              to sell their products or services to those who do not know
              better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government
              for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for
              all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official
              organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is
              not true in New Orleans.

              The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day
              (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is
              on a different day each year. Fat Tuesday changes every year
              because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
              Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday. Most visitors plan
              to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and
              stay through Ash Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when
              Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years

              The weather during Mardi gras can vary from very cold to very
              warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one extreme to the
              other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes
              since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon. Since you
              will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and
              clothes that can get somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the
              forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely
              want to bring a raincoat!

              The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New
              Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus and
              Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the
              streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday
              and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a
              weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days
              to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on
              that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival goes on all
              day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing
              all of the costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience

              By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a
              family celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans feel
              guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to
              every parade, because we used to use "taking the children" as our
              excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of
              the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed
              animals, beads and more. The only place you should avoid with kids
              is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass anyway). We
              recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue
              near Napoleon, since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end
              of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a
              family area where you will see many families staking out their
              parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having
              fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about
              the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi
              Gras. You may also want to consider taking your kids to the
              parades in the suburban areas like Metairie, which is only 10
              minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the
              Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld
              features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!

              The Mardi Gras Indians only parade on Mardi Gras day and on Super
              Sunday (generally the Sunday closest to St. Joseph’s Day in
              March). The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but
              they happen in and around their inner city neighborhoods. Some
              sources say that you will see the Creole Wild West tribe at the
              corner of LaSalle and 2nd Streets sometime between 9 a.m. and 11
              a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu passes by. Other tribes meet at the
              corner of Claiborne and Orleans following the Zulu parade. The New
              Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday
              on the third Sunday of March, around St. Joseph's Day. Their
              festivities begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at Washington &
              LaSalle Streets) where the Mardi Gras Indians once again dress in
              their feathers and suits, and take to the streets to meet other
              "gangs." For the Indian Sunday parade route, visit our Super
              Sunday page. Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations
              traditionally hold thier "Super Sunday" parade on the Sunday
              closest to St. Joseph's Day, with the event beginning at Bayou St.
              John. In recent years, there has been yet a third Super Sunday
              called Big Sunday that falls in April during the open weekend
              between French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest. No specific details
              are available on these events at this time.

              The best methods of transportation will be via taxi/ride-sharing
              services, streetcar or rental car depending on where you're

              difficult.

              Red Cross volunteers, in partnership with New Orleans first
              responders, will be providing basic first aid in some of the most
              populated areas along the parade routes. They are trained in CPR
              and first aid and will assist the ill and injured at each of their
              stations positioned along the parade routes. First aid stations
              will be available on the following corners along St. Charles
              Avenue during many of our larger parades the last two weeks of
              Mardi Gras season: Canal Street | Napoleon Avenue | Washington
              Avenue | Felicity Street | Lee Circle Additionally, first aid
              stations will be available at Orleans Avenue and North Hennessy
              Street, as well as North Carrolton Avenue and Bienville Street on
              the Saturday before Mardi Gras for the Endymion parade.

              There is not a single official Mardi Gras theme since there is no
              single organization in charge of Mardi Gras. Each parade krewe
              decides on its own theme each year, which is often kept secret
              until the parade. Their costumes, floats, some of their throws,
              and their "official" Mardi Gras poster (if they have one) reflect
              this theme. For example, after 9/11, patriotic themes were
              popular. Most of the krewes are named after figures from Greek,
              Roman, and Egyptian mythology, but some are named after the
              neighborhood where they parade

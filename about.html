          The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing
          through Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th centuries to the French
          House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
          Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies. On March 2,
          1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de
          Bienville arrived at a plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New
          Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it
          <img
            id="img_about1"
            src="img/img/gallery/50_small.jpg"
            alt="indien tradition clothing"
          />
          was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort
          Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the
          tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very
          first Mardi Gras. In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque
          de la Mobile), similar to those that form our current Mardi Gras
          krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was
          formed and paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held
          with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex
          would parade with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the
          coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday. New Orleans was
          established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was
          celebrated openly in New Orleans, but not with the parades we know
          today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de
          Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model
          for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today. The earliest reference
          to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish
          colonial governing body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent &
          Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and carnival
          organizations formed in New Orleans. By the late 1830s, New Orleans
          held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders
          to celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux,"
          lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each event an exciting
          air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed
          the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to
          represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New
          Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked
          balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.
        </p>
        
          The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as
          krewes; most follow the same parade schedule and route each year. The
          earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
          earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several
          modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
          events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming
          celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus
          (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as
          the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Clubâ€”a predominantly African American
          krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The
          most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons,
          decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys,
          but throws can also include lingerie and more sordid items. Major
          krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi
          Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club and the Rex
          Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate
          costumes add to the fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all
          ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon
          Street and in New Orleans and Dauphin, major parades originate in the
          Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles
          Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter.
          Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the
          Courts" between Rex and Comus.

                In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers,
                was formed. This is also the first recorded account of Mardi
                Gras "throws."<br /><br />
                Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and
                they even printed "Carnival Edition" lithographs of parades'
                fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes
                and floats were always carefully guarded before the procession).
                At first, these reproductions were small, and details could not
                be clearly seen. But beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade
                "Visions of Other Worlds," these chromolithographs could be
                produced in full, saturated color, doing justice to the float
                and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and
                B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was brought to life
                by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who
                for 40 years was responsible for creating all of Carnival's
                floats and processional outfits.
                <br /><br />
                1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of
                Carnival, Rex, to preside over the first daytime parade. To
                honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the
                businessmen introduced Romanoff's family colors of purple, green
                and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for
                justice; gold for power; and green for faith. This was also the
                Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I
                Cease to Love," was cemented, due in part to the Duke's fondness
                for the tune.
                <br /><br />
                The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in
                New Orleans instead of France, culminating with Comus'
                magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species,"
                in which exotic paper-mache' animal costumes served as the basis
                for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials,
                including Governor Henry Warmoth. In 1875, Governor Warmoth
                signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday
                in Louisiana, which it still is.
                <br /><br />
                Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras
                krewes today developed from private social clubs with
                restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade
                organizations are completely funded by their members, New
                Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"

                Mardi Gras is full of secrets, and the Mardi Gras Indians are as
                much a part of that secrecy as any other carnival organization.
                Their parade dates, times and routes are never published in
                advance, although they do tend to gather in the same areas every
                year.

                The Mardi Gras Indians are comprised, in large part, of the
                African-American communities of New Orleans's inner city. While
                these Indians have paraded for well over a century, their parade
                is perhaps the least recognized Mardi Gras tradition.

                "Mardi Gras Indians--the parade most white people don't see. The
                ceremonial procession is loose, the parade is not scheduled for
                a particular time or route...that is up to the Big Chief." -
                Larry Bannock
                <br /><br />
                Traditional Mardi Gras organizations form a "krewe." A krewe
                often names their parade after a particular Roman or Greek
                mythological hero or god. The ranking structure of a Mardi Gras
                Krewe is a parody of royalty: King, Queen, Dukes, Knights and
                Captains, or some variation of that theme. Many of the more
                established krewes allow membership by invitation only.
                <br /><br />Few in the ghetto felt they could ever participate
                in the typical New Orleans parade. Historically, slavery and
                racism were at the root of this cultural separation. The black
                neighborhoods in New Orleans gradually developed their own style
                of celebrating Mardi Gras. Their krewes are named for imaginary
                Indian tribes according to the streets of their ward or gang.
                <br /><br />
                The Mardi Gras Indians named themselves after native Indians to
                pay them respect for their assistance in escaping the tyranny of
                slavery. It was often local Indians who accepted slaves into
                their society when they made a break for freedom. They have
                never forgotten this support.
